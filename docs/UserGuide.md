### 1. Installation

**NOTE: The current version on the Web Store is not updated as our update is still pending review. It can still be used with the exception of a bug.


If you were to use this version and download straight from the store, it is mandatory to change and set your own options before it is able to work.

Under section 2.4, there is a guide on how to access options and set your own. Reminder that all options will be set with 'ALT' by default, i.e if you set a keybind to be '1', it will be activated with 'ALT + 1'.

We apologize for the inconvenience, and will update this README with the latest changes.

Last Updated: 26/7 10 PM**

Navigate to the Chrome Web Store and look for the web application 'Synch'. Alternativelty, the link can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/synch/dgmaablnmfpnkipeiklohhlfdfbdifjl).

*Alternatively, if you would like to obtain the latest version and avoid the bug, you can download a zip file from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14PNAcwuR4uNXAvScM_-yJtctA_jjwKlB/view?usp=sharing).

Extract the zip into a folder.

Once the folder has been created, developers can navigate to the extensions page in Chrome. The button is at the top right hand side of the browser next to the URL bar, and is labelled extensions.

Clicking it, developers can click 'Manage Extensions at the bottom'.

Developers will then be redirected to an extension manager page.

On the right hand side, ensure that developer mode is turned on.

On the left hand side, click 'Load Unpackaged' and select the folder to upload Synch.

Able to use as per normal without dealing with the bug.*

### 2. Usage

#### 2.1 Main Keypresses

| Key-Binding | Functionality                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ALT + 1     | Toggles between paragraphs.                                                                               |
| ALT + 2     | Toggles between headers.                                                                                  |
| ALT + 3     | Brings up a search bar to search for keywords among the links on the site.                                |
| ALT + 4     | After searching, allows the user to toggle between the results. The titles of the links will be read out. |
| ALT + 0     | Redirects the user to the last link being read out.                                                       |
| ALT + q     | Toggles the webpage in order                                                                              |

The default settings are listed above.

All settings have to be used with 'ALT'. This is to ensure that each keypress is intentional and will not result in accidental/ unwanted browser commands.

The extension works based on keypresses. As such, a single keypress of the bound key will cause it to carry out its functionality.

Hit the same button twice within a time limit to allow the extension to read the previous message instead.

The default time limit is 0.5 seconds.

#### 2.2 Highlighting

To facilitate user experience, the current section that Synch is reading will be highlighted in yellow, as shown below:

#### 2.3 Redirecting

By default, users can hit `ALT + 3` to bring up a search bar. This search bar is used to search for hyperlinks on the page.

![](/imgs/hyperlink_search.jpg)

Users can then search for a keyword, i.e if the site had a link directing users to a 'World News' section, users can just type 'world' in the searchbar.

There are two results of the search, either a success message or a failure message from the engine if it could not find anything matching your search.

Users can then hit 'ALT + 4' to cycle through the results of the search if it was successful. The engine then reads the titles of the links. 

Users can then hit 'ALT + 0' to redirect the site to the last read title.


#### 2.4 Settings

| Settings | Property                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| rate     | Changes the speed at which the reader will read out text. |

Apart from the key bindings mentioned under section 2.1, these are the other settings present which allows the user to customize their screen reader.

To bring up the settings menu, simply navigate to the top right of the screen to find the extensions manager.

![](/imgs/settings_extension.jpg)

Under options, the user can click this to bring one to the settings page as shown below.

![](/imgs/settings_page.jpg)

Here, the user is able to customize their settings accordingly.

There are a few keys which are not allowed. Among them are the 'SHIFT, TAB, SPACE, d, e, f, \' keys. This is due to conflicts with the browser default commands. We seek your understanding to work with the constraints and would recommend users to use number/ alphabet keys.

Since all options are used with 'ALT', it is enabled by default. Hence, if '1' is used as a keybind, it will only be activated upon 'ALT + 1', and users only need to key '1' into the text field.

#### 2.5 Ad Detection

The screen readers present on the web as of now often do not have ad support and will usually say "ad" when toggled over. As such, we wanted to have built in support to avoid such issues by detecting ads and blocking them. For non visually impaired individuals, we hope that this also provides a better user experience. However, our ad detection is not full proof, and as such may miss certain ads.

*NOTE: The ad detection may at times interfere with images on the site either due to the ad detection's strength/ format of the website.*

Users may then right clidk on what they deem is an ad, and under 'Synch', there will be an option to report an ad.
