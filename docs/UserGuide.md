### 1. Installation

Navigate to the Chrome Web Store and look for the web application 'Synch'.

Alternatively, download our package from our GitHub Page.

### 2. Usage

#### 2.1 Main Keypresses

| Key-Binding | Functionality                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1           | Toggles between paragraphs.                                  |
| 2           | Toggles between headers.                                     |
| 3           | Brings up a search bar to search for keywords among the links on the site. |
| 4           | After searching, allows the user to toggle between the results. The titles of the links will be read out. |
| 0           | Redirects the user to the last link being read out.          |
| r           | Brings out the ad detection system.                          |
| m           | Stops the reader, and allows the user to refresh the page.   |

The extension works based on keypresses. As such, a single keypress of the bound key will cause it to carry out its functionality.

Hit the same button twice within a time limit to allow the extension to read the previous message instead.

The default time limit is 0.5 seconds, which can be changed in the settings page. Read on to find out about the different settings.

#### 2.2 Highlighting 

To facilitate user experience, the current section that Synch is reading will be highlighted in yellow, as shown below:
