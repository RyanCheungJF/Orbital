### 1. Installation

*NOTE: Unfortuantely, at the point of updating this README, the extension is still pending review from Chrome's store team. As such, we cannot offer a direct link to download the extension, but will update the link once it is done.*

*Instead, we would like to ask users to:*

Download our ZIP here.

Extract the contents to a folder.

Once the folder has been created, developers can navigate to the extensions page in Chrome. The button is at the top right hand side of the browser next to the URL bar, and is labelled extensions.

Clicking it, developers can click 'Manage Extensions at the bottom'.

Developers will then be redirected to an extension manager page.

On the right hand side, ensure that developer mode is turned on.

On the left hand side, click 'Load Unpackaged' and select the folder to upload Synch.

Once done, enable Synch and it will be ready to run. Happy testing!

*NOTE: Currently waiting for Chrome's store team response, but link will be updated as soon as it is approved.*
Navigate to the Chrome Web Store and look for the web application 'Synch'. Alternativelty, the link can be found here.

### 2. Usage

#### 2.1 Main Keypresses

| Key-Binding | Functionality                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ALT + 1     | Toggles between paragraphs.                                                                               |
| ALT + 2     | Toggles between headers.                                                                                  |
| ALT + 3     | Brings up a search bar to search for keywords among the links on the site.                                |
| ALT + 4     | After searching, allows the user to toggle between the results. The titles of the links will be read out. |
| ALT + 0     | Redirects the user to the last link being read out.                                                       |
| ALT + q     | Toggles the webpage in order                                                                              |

The default settings are listed above.

All settings have to be used with 'ALT'. This is to ensure that each keypress is intentional and will not result in accidental/ unwanted browser commands.

The extension works based on keypresses. As such, a single keypress of the bound key will cause it to carry out its functionality.

Hit the same button twice within a time limit to allow the extension to read the previous message instead.

The default time limit is 0.5 seconds.

#### 2.2 Highlighting

To facilitate user experience, the current section that Synch is reading will be highlighted in yellow, as shown below:

#### 2.3 Settings

| Settings | Property                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| rate     | Changes the speed at which the reader will read out text. |

Apart from the key bindings mentioned under section 2.1, these are the other settings present which allows the user to customize their screen reader.

To bring up the settings menu, simply navigate to the top right of the screen to find the extensions manager.

Under options, the user can click this to bring one to the settings page as shown below.

![](/imgs/settings_page.jpg)

Here, the user is able to customize their settings accordingly.

There are a few keys which are not allowed. Among them are the 'SHIFT, TAB, SPACE, d, e, f, \' keys. This is due to conflicts with the browser default commands. We seek your understanding to work with the constraints and would recommend users to use number/ alphabet keys.

#### 2.4 Ad Detection

The screen readers present on the web as of now often do not have ad support and will usually say "ad" when toggled over. As such, we wanted to have built in support to avoid such issues by detecting ads and blocking them. For non visually impaired individuals, we hope that this also provides a better user experience. However, our ad detection is not full proof, and as such may miss certain ads.

*NOTE: The ad detection may at times interfere with images on the site either due to the ad detection's strength/ format of the website.*

Users may then right clidk on what they deem is an ad, and under 'Synch', there will be an option to report an ad.
